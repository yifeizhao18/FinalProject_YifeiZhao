Welcome! Welcome to the central hospital!! It is a very stormy night. You are here because this hospital got shut done due to something abnormal. As a private investigator, you immediately stepped in to investigate. GOOD LUCK!! You will have to escape all of the rooms and be careful to not get killed.
